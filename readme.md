# 🌌 Starry Night Game 🌙

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based game that creates a starry night scene with interactive elements. It uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, with the game environment displayed on a `<canvas>` element. The background includes animated stars that flicker, a glowing moon, and a "start game" button. The game initiates upon clicking the button, and background music starts playing as the game loads. 🎶
